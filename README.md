This is my final project for Music 108: Cognitive Perception of Music

It is a program that works adjunct with jMIR software. It analyzes select features of a corpus of music (which are chosen when the jMIR files run),
and then it takes in another song and outputs scores that describe how similar that song is to the corpus of music for each of the chosen
features.
